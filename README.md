# Partnering with Regional Fisheries Management Organisations to build global data sets of tuna fisheries

The paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the global data set of annual catches of tuna fisheries built from the compilation and harmonization of public domain data available from the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (tRFMOs), namely the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna ([CCSBT](https://ccsbt.org/)), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission ([IATTC](https://www.iattc.org/)), the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ([ICCAT](https://iccat.int/)), the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission ([IOTC](https://iotc.org/)), and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission ([WCPFC](https://wcpfc.int/)).

- The full paper can be generated from the script generate_all.R.
- The data set is contained in the zipped file inputs/data/global_nominal_catch_firms_level0.zip.
- All code lists and mappings are downloaded from the repository of the Fisheries Data Interoperability (FDI) working group.
