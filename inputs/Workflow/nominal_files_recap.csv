nominal_catch_wcpfc_level0,"title:Annual catch of tuna, tuna-like and shark species in the West Pacific Ocean (%temporal_extent:start% - %temporal_extent:end%) (WCPFC level 0)","abstract:This dataset lists the annually-spatially aggregated catch of tuna, tuna-like and shark species from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) from %temporal_extent:start% to %temporal_extent:end%. Species-specific catches are stratified by year, fishing gear, vessel flag reporting country. It corresponds to the catch part of the WCPFC nominal catch (task1) dataset.
 
This dataset was downloaded on the WCPFC website. It was then restructured to be in line with the Tuna atlas database structure (columns normalization, names, etc.). However the content of data and the code lists were kept exactly as their are available in the source dataset.
 
The description below is extracted from the WCPFC web page where the dataset has been downloaded.
 
Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :
 
The tables of catch statistics cover the main commercial tuna and billfish species caught in the region: albacore (Thunnus alalunga), bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), black marlin (Makaira indica), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The WCFPC, through their member countries, are now obliged to compile estimates of key shark species, some of which are now covered in the longline fleet tables: blue shark (Prionace glauca), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and mako sharks (Isurus spp.). Catches of other species are not covered explicitly, and discards are not considered.
 
The main industrial fishing methods employed in the WCPFC region include longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and troll. The domestic fisheries of Indonesia and the Philippines employ several other methods. Driftnet fishing for albacore in the South Pacific Ocean ceased in 1991. Individual fleets presented herein cover vessels that are flagged to that nation and those vessels considered to be 'chartered' according to the WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure (CMM-2012-05) on Charter Notification.
 
For the purse-seine fishery, recent studies using observer data (e.g. Lawson, 2007, Lawson, 2010, Lawson, 2012, Lawson, 2013, Lawson, 2014, Hampton and Williams, 2011, Hampton and Williams, 2015) show that the logsheet-reported catch, mainly for associated sets, should contain higher quantities of yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have been misreported as skipjack tuna. Purse-seine catch estimates that have been adjusted with species compositions determined from observer grab samples corrected for size selectivity bias (see Lawson, 2010, Lawson, 2012, Lawson, 2013, and Lawson, 2014) are presented herein as the best available WCFPC purse-seine catch estimates for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna. All composite tables and figures referring to purse-seine species catch are consistent with these estimates. The estimates of purse seine catch by species may differ from the original estimates provided by WCPFC member countries for their fleets, but total purse seine catch will not differ. The purse seine species catch estimates are produced from statistical models and will therefore change from year to year as more data become available.
 
For the longline fishery, estimates of key shark species have improved in recent years but for most fleets remain uncertain due to (i) clear under-reporting of catches, or (ii) very low coverage of observer data used to estimate these catches.
 
The tables of annual catch estimates for individual fleets cover those years during which the fleet is known to have fished; the lack of recent years in a table implies that the fleet has ceased fishing.
 
The sources of the estimates are available from the SPC Oceanic Fisheries Programme.",,"owner:PeterW@spc.int_

Characteristics, specific issues and problems that need to be taken into account :
 
Estimates of the global SBT catch will be updated on an annual basis within two months of the CCSBT annual meeting in October of each year. Note: reviews of SBT data in 2006 indicated that southern bluefin tuna catches may have been substantially under-reported over the previous 10-20 years and the data presented here do not yet include estimates for this unreported catch.
 
It should be noted that the data for individual Flag States and fishing entities shown here may differ to data that those Flag States and fishing entities have provided separately to other organisations. This is in part due to the data manipulations conducted by the CCSBT in producing this dataset (a variety of data sources were used, requiring a range of correction and raising techniques) and in part due to differences in the data provided by individual Flag States and fishing entities to the CCSBT and to other organisations. In particular, the post 1994 SBT data provided by Japan to the CCSBT differs from the post 1994 SBT data that Japan provides to other regional fishery management organisations. The data that Japan provides to CCSBT takes advantage of a Real Time Monitoring Program for SBT to collect daily catch and effort reports from SBT targeting fishing vessels and this is considered to minimise the time lag in availability of the Japanese SBT log book data.""",,"owner:CMillar@ccsbt.org_

Nominal catch datasets for stock assessments should be accessed through the dedicated meeting page for the IOTC working party.

Note that the catch estimates in this data file differ from the ‘best scientific estimates’ of nominal catch used for stock assessment purposes and published on the dedicated meeting pages for each IOTC Working Party. The best scientific estimates disaggregates catches recorded under species or gear aggregates recorded in the IOTC database reported by countries, which are then assigned by species or gear when the Secretariat has access to alternate sources of information such as statistical publications, fishery bulletins or other information. For this reason, catches by individual species or gear published on the IOTC meeting pages may differ from the nominal catches available from the data file available here.

doi:10.5281/zenodo.5745958","title:Global annual catch of tuna, tuna-like and shark species (%temporal_extent:start% - %temporal_extent:end%) (FIRMS level 0)","abstract:This dataset lists the global catch (in metric tons, t) of tuna and tuna-like species from %temporal_extent:start% to %temporal_extent:end%. 

This dataset was computed using public domain, annual nominal catch datasets (also called total catch) released by the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (t-RFMOs): the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). 

Species-specific catches are stratified by year, fishing gear, reporting / fishing fleet and area (essentially, the t-RFMOs competence areas apart from the CCSBT that has no defined area of competence and manages the global catch of southern bluefin tuna). 

“FIRMS level 0” identifies the processes applied to the primary datasets by the FIsheries and Resources Monitoring System (FIRMS)  to generate the dataset.

t-RFMO specific descriptions of the original input data sets can be found at the following links:

- CCSBT: https://www.ccsbt.org/en/content/sbt-data 
- IATTC: https://www.iattc.org/PublicDomainData/IATTC-Catch-by-species1.htm 
- ICCAT: https://www.iccat.int/en/accesingdb.html 
- IOTC: https://iotc.org/data/datasets/latest/NC 
- WCPFC: https://www.wcpfc.int/public-domain 

The processes applied to produce this FIRMS level 0 dataset at global scale consist of a series of steps:

Merging of the primary nominal catch datasets released by the 5 tuna RFMOs, that might also include dead discards (e.g., ICCAT and IATTC)
Removal of all Southern Bluefin Tuna data provided by t-RFMOs other than the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), which is considered the only authoritative source of information for the species
Mapping of the original code lists (t-RFMO specific) to standard FAO / CWP code lists (e.g., for gears and species) or to ad-hoc classifications as in the case of reporting / fishing fleets. These mappings have been done in collaboration with the t-RFMOs Secretariats and might be subject to future revisions

More details on the processes are provided in the lineage section._
info:In addition to the respective specific issues of each t-RFMOs’ datasets, the following should also be taken into account :

- Catches in the Pacific ocean might be partially double counted: in fact, IATTC and WCPFC (who report the data respectively for the Eastern Pacific and Western Pacific oceans) have an overlapping zone in their respective area of competence, whose catches cannot be easily separated to prevent double-counting and redundancy in this dataset.

- The geographical stratification adopted for this dataset is: a) major FAO fishing area for the Indian ocean (IOTC), b) stocks areas / management units for the Atlantic ocean (ICCAT), c) convention areas for the Pacific ocean (IATTC and WCPFC) and d) Global catch of southern bluefin tuna (CCSBT)._
