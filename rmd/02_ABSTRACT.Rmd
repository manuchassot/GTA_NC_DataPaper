We built the most complete data set of annual catches of global tuna fisheries for the period 1950-2021 by compiling and harmonizing public domain data available from the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (tRFMOs). Under the umbrella of the Fisheries and Resources Monitoring System (FIRMS) of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), we developed a data flow process with the tRFMO Secretariats to seamlessly build global tuna fisheries data sets through the implementation of a data exchange format based on the standards of the FAO Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP). The data set covers `r length(NC[species_aggregate == FALSE, unique(species)])` medium- and large-sized pelagic species that occur in both neritic and oceanic habitats of the world oceans and are monitored by tRFMOs, including `r length(NC[species_group_gta %in% c("Neritic tunas", "Tropical tunas", "Temperate tunas") & species_aggregate == FALSE, unique(species)])` tunas, `r length(NC[species_group_gta == "Billfishes" & species_aggregate == FALSE, unique(species)])` billfish, `r length(NC[species_group_gta == "Spanish mackerels" & species_aggregate == FALSE, unique(species)])` Spanish mackerels, `r length(NC[species_group_gta == "Bonitos and mackerels" & species_aggregate == FALSE, unique(species)])` bonitos, and wahoo. Although considered to be uncertain and incomplete due to under-reporting, catches reported for `r length(NC[species_group_gta %in% c("Rays", "Sharks") & species_aggregate == FALSE, unique(species)])` species of pelagic sharks and rays that may be targeted or incidentally caught in tuna and tuna-like fisheries are included in the data set. This data set provides a benchmark for the monitoring and assessment of the artisanal and industrial fisheries of more than `r length(unique(NC$fishing_fleet))` fishing fleets from `r length(unique(NC$country_code))` countries that have exploited tuna and tuna-like species for both subsistence and commercial interest over the last seven decades.
